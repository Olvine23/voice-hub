Behind every man, behind every man….
“As I walk through the valley of the shadow of….of this life, no, MY life. I fear not what this night holds. It’s not going to be different from the other nights. I will wait for him to come from ‘work’, I will tend to him like a proper proverbs 31 woman . I will wait on the couch which has now become my bed, I’ll take his coat, help him out of his shoes and socks and hand him a clean pair of sandals. He will stagger away to the dining table and I will make sure his food is still hot, he always likes it that way, else he hits me with….with those…those …hands. Those hands that send the plate flying away from the table very close to my face missing it by a whisker.

<br />

I will bend down to pick up the shards of broken glass lying all over the floor. I take one final glance at the last of my mother’s set of plates given to me by her on my wedding day, I have become that plate. Our only difference is that its predicament is over. No hot food will further be put on it. Me on the other hand…I feel a sharp pain in my hand and see his foot on top of my hand. The piece of glass tears through my skin causing blood to flow out on the glass and the floor. He will press harder, the cut will go deeper and I will bite onto my lip harder to not scream. I will wait until he is done with his assault. He stops when I don’t struggle.

<br />

I will go to the kitchen and let the water run through the cut just like every other night, tonight’s no different. I have become numb to the pain. I am emotionally scarred and that’s my fault. He’s probably off to bed now, or so I think but my short-lived peace is over when I feel his hands snake through my waist as he stands behind me and turns me around to face him. I will panic but show no fear. He runs his hand down my cheek soothingly with those hands like he did on our honeymoon. Maybe he feels sorry for what he did. He probably didn’t mean it, or so I think.

<br />

He then cups my cheek, then moves it to my hair that he once oh so softly claimed to be breathtaking and clenches a fistful of it slamming my face into the wall and then the kitchen sink,the floor ,then back up the wall again and keeps slamming it into the wall, 1,2,3…until I lose count, while his other hand ensures I don’t move. I think of our daughter. She is my strength. She is my happy place. If I allow myself to be weak, I will have failed her. I will take a million beatings, if it means giving her a complete family. Those hands that drew circles on the back of my hands on our first date and those lips that kissed my eyes when I was asleep, the same lips that are now curved into a smirk as if satisfied by his handy work on my face.

<br />

Behind every man, right?

<br />

I have cut off all of my friends so I could dedicate all of my time to him. It’s the bed I made hence I will lay in it. I can still hear the neighbors’ voices in my head. ‘Have you seen the black eye he gave her?’ ‘Honey that’s just a drop in the ocean, didn’t you see how she was limping just the other day?’ ‘Stay at home moms’. Back stabbing bitches .More reason to never scream because they will turn it into the estate agenda the following day but I will walk…walk through the valley of the shadow…the shadow of my life.

<br />

I will not wallow in sadness. These wounds are not going to tend to themselves. From the way I use rubbing alcohol and bandages, one would think I went to medical school .That’s a good one.It is not funny. Okay maybe a little. But guess what, this is a new day. I can hear him in the bathroom taking a shower. I will make us breakfast, in fact I’ll make his favorite. I will rush to the ironing room first and iron up his suit and place it on our-his bed and head out to set the dining table. Be positive. I will let myself be filled only with positive vibes throughout the day. I see his shadow first and then his shoes then his outfit. Even now, he still looks breath-taking, like a god- almost. It is then that I take a good look at him. He is not wearing the outfit that I chose for him, maybe he felt in the mood for a change today. He shoots me a smile and I smile back, positive.He serves us a cup of coffee each as he takes a seat adjacent to me. I start drinking and he looks at me, takes a sip and pours the rest on my sitting figure. . The coffee burn is less intense than the iron, it instinctively causes me to loosen my grip on my own coffee mug causing it to generously spill its copious contents on the tourniquet warapped around the palm of my hand.

<br />

He looks at me scornfully before he utters his next words “I want you gone by the time I’m back from work.” And by that he turns around and leaves. Too much for positivity I guess. Going back to my parents’ home would result in outrageous accusations especially in my village. ‘How dare she leave her husband?’ I will never let my mother go through all that persecution. Traditions, stupid ones for that matter. As soon as he leaves I want to curl up in bed, well couch, and cry. But if I cry, how will I teach my daughter how to be strong. I do know that I can’t keep feeding her the stupid lie to her for the rest of her life .She will grow up and she will ask me the same question ‘mommy what happened to your hand?’ and I will lie ‘I cut myself while preparing dinner.’ Only then she will not buy the lie because she will be all grown up and no longer four.

<br />

I will caress her cheeks in a benign way with my hands and tell her that I love her and her father so much and that we will be happy forever. I hear my mother’s voice in my head the first time I told her about my argument with my husband. ‘He just hit me once and he apologized for it mom. He loves me and we will be together forever.’ ‘Forever is overrated, my child.’ ‘A man who loves you will never hit you no matter how angry he is with you.’ ‘Mom, I will be fine.’ Fine is the word I use when I am living but not alive. Today I decide that fine is an understatement, I am more than fine. You will be there for your husband, your daughter and, and…You. Because you got you. I got me.
