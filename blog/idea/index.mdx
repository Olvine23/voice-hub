<span style="font-size:2.5rem;" className="text-green-900">W</span>hat’s Worse?
Having someone to love, to hold, to hug tight but be afraid to give your all to them or having no one at all?
Looking at that special someone in their eyes and have your subconscious do a quick fast forward where they won’t be as special or avoiding having to go through that by maintaining your loneliness?
Wondering what someone sees in you and then unconsciously trying to sabotage that or just let no one in?
Having someone but always being scared to lose them or not caring about anyone at all?
Never letting yourself be vulnerable in front of them or just NOT having them at all?
It’s never really as simple for you as it is for others.

<br />

<br />

What if I give them a chance and then they see me, my demons, my demotions and they decide that it was fun while it lasted?
You know that you’ve actually lured your demons out of the closet and under your bed… you all are buddies but what if they can’t?
What if when that happens you’re too deep in it that it rips you apart when it happens?
What if on the outside you look like this goddess but underneath that is a scared kid who doesn’t have a clue on how to face that monster that goes by the name life?
What if you’re broken in so many ways that the grace of that special someone is not enough to save you?
With all this ambiguity comes answers when you decide ‘you know what, screw it, I’m gonna give it a try’
So you do, you actually decide to give it a shot…what happens happens is your new motto
You pick up your pieces and go into it
The kind of love they show you confuses you at first
You’ve grown up in a tough love kind of setting and just not used to be handled so delicately
You wanna pour your heart out into them but you know better than to do that

<br />

What if they betray me?
What if it’s just for show?
What if this is a huge mistake?
What if I’m not cut out for this?
But he’s real
But he’s here
But is he in it as much as I am?
But she’s here
But she’s real
But is she in it as much as I am?
There goes your overthinking, overloving…everything’s just has to be extra for you
You can’t help it,
It’s funny how the past catches up with us when we least expect it
No relationship is complete without some bit of arguing here and there, yours is no exception
Your first argument happens(as expected),and you run away like the scaredy kid you are
Then comes the rollercoaster with the rises, falls, twists, and freakish turns
Finally, a feeling you can actually relate to, no more rainbows and ponies
Now you actually contemplate on whether to leave or stay
You go over the pros and cons… what outweighs what?
Do you really want to lose that special someone?
Do you really want to lose the only person who knows each side of you, good and bad and still shows up for you ALL THE TIME?
Is it worth losing them and for what, a few erroneous interpretations of what seems to be the best thing to have happened to you in your entire life?
To be continued…
